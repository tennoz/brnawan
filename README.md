Dear team,

Thank you for your collaboration during the past period around the new structure for Information Delivery.
It's because of this collaboration, we were able to achieve an 86% 1st preference realization. This translates an 86% alignment between the Information Delivery objectives and your personal objectives. This percentage is even higher than my expectations.

With regards to the rest of the 14%, as agreed they will be given priority in mid 2020. I understand you can feel unfortunate, but we are happy to have you as part of the team. It's just that 100% alignment cannot be achieved given the workload needed from each team.

The next step will be to define the handover plan for each of you and the joining date. I will work with the leads on this plan.
